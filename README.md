## 🛰️ Local Proxy Server

Modern Elegoo printers often have a built-in limit of 4 simultaneous connections. Since the video stream consumes one of these by itself, users can easily hit this limit. 

The optional proxy server acts as a single gateway, routing all commands and the video stream through one stable connection, effectively bypassing these limits.

## 🖨️ Supported Printers

Elegoo releases new models frequently, and this integration is designed to be as "future-proof" as possible. Instead of worrying about specific version numbers, look at the **Protocol** your printer uses.

> **Don't see your specific model? Try it anyway!**
> If your printer uses the SDCP protocol (which almost all modern networked Elegoo printers do), there is a very high chance it will work perfectly. This list is **non-exhaustive** and grows with the community.

### ✅ Modern Printers (SDCP over WebSocket)
Most newer models utilize WebSockets for communication. This integration offers full support for:

* **Mars Range** (e.g., Mars 5, 5 Ultra)
* **Saturn Range** (e.g., Saturn 4, 4 Ultra)
* **Centauri Range** (e.g., Centauri Carbon)

### 🧪 Legacy Printers (SDCP over MQTT)
Older networked models typically use MQTT. These are supported in **Beta**, meaning most features work, though some metadata (like start/end times or cover images) may be missing due to the limitations of the older protocol.

* **Saturn Range** (e.g., Saturn 2, 3 Ultra)
* **Mars Range** (e.g., Mars 3, 4 Ultra)
* **Jupiter Range**

**Known Limitations for MQTT:**
* `Begin Time`, `End Time`, and `Cover Image` sensors will show "Unknown."
* Standard sensors (status, layers, temps, progress) function normally.

### 🆕 CC2 FDM Printers (LAN-Only Connection)
CC2 (Centauri Carbon 2) printers use an inverted MQTT architecture where the printer runs its own broker. **This integration supports LOCAL network connections only.**

**Supported Models:**
* Centauri Carbon 2
* Elegoo Cura (some models)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: LAN-Only Mode Required**

CC2 printers **MUST** be configured for LAN-Only mode:

1. On your printer: **Settings → Network → LAN Only Mode**
2. **Enable** LAN Only Mode
3. Save and restart if prompted
4. Ensure printer and Home Assistant are on the **same network/subnet**

**Cloud mode is NOT supported.** Cloud connectivity requires Elegoo's OAuth2 authentication and cloud relay services, which are not currently implemented. This integration connects directly to your printer over your local network only.

**Network Requirements:**
- Printer and Home Assistant must be on the same network/VLAN/subnet
- For containerized Home Assistant (Docker/Kubernetes): Use host networking or proper network bridging
- Port 1883 (MQTT) must be accessible between HA and printer

**Optional GCode capture proxy:** 

The printers report only a total filament usage value over their normal
telemetry (MQTT for CC2, SDCP for CC1) — the per-slot breakdown (how
much each Canvas spool contributed) exists only inside the G-code file,
and there is no way to retrieve a file from the printer after it has
been sent.

The [elegoo-printer-proxy](https://github.com/lantern-eight/elegoo-printer-proxy)
sits between ElegooSlicer and the printer, transparently capturing
every G-code file at upload time and parsing out per-slot filament
data. It supports both the CC2 and the CC1 (Centauri Carbon). Configure
the proxy URL in the integration options
(Settings → Integrations → Elegoo → Configure).

With the proxy configured, additional sensors are created: per-slot
A1–A4 grams, volume, length, and color, plus total filament cost
and change count when the slicer provides them. See
[SPOOLMAN.md](SPOOLMAN.md) for automations that push this data to
Spoolman for spool weight tracking.

See [CC2 Protocol Documentation](docs/CC2_PROTOCOL.md) for technical details.

## ⚙️ Installation

The recommended way to install this integration is through the [Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)](https://hacs.xyz/).

1. In HACS, go to **Integrations** and click the **"+"** button.
2. Search for **"Elegoo Printers"** and select it.
3. Click **"Download"** and **restart Home Assistant**.

---

## 🔧 Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**.
2. Click **"Add Integration"** and search for **"Elegoo Printers"**.
3. The integration will attempt to **auto-discover** printers on your network.
4. If no printer is found, select **"Configure manually"** and enter your printer's IP address or hostname.

**Note:** If **auto-discovery** didn't work, you may need some [advanced network setup](https://github.com/danielcherubini/elegoo-homeassistant/wiki/Connecting-Elegoo-Printers-to-Home-Assistant-Across-Different-Networks).

### ⚠️ Firmware v1.1.29 Bug Notice
Elegoo firmware **v1.1.29** contains a bug preventing remote control of lights and temperatures **while a print is in progress**. This is a firmware limitation; if you require these features during prints, consider using v1.1.25 if available for your model.

## 🛠️ Services

### `update_ip`
When a printer's IP changes (e.g. via DHCP), there is no need to delete and re-add the integration. The `update_ip` service updates the printer's IP address stored in a config entry and reloads that entry, so the fix takes **seconds** instead of a full re-setup.

- The `entry_id` field is a **dropdown**: pick which printer, then type the new address in the `ip_address` field.
- Two ways to invoke it:
  - **UI:** **Developer Tools** → **Actions** → `elegoo_printer.update_ip` — the config-entry dropdown and IP field appear there, and a "return response" option is available through the service response.
  - **Automation / script:** call the service with the config entry's UUID and the new address in the data:
    ```yaml
    action: elegoo_printer.update_ip
    data:
      entry_id: <config entry UUID>
      ip_address: "192.168.1.3"
    ```
- **Watcher scripts:** an external IP-detection script (or a router webhook relay) can call the service the moment the printer's new address is known — **no user intervention** required.

**Known behavior:**
- On a **still-connected (LOADED) entry** the reload effectively runs twice — once triggered by the data change and once explicitly. Home Assistant serializes both, but that means a **second full teardown/reconnect** of the printer connection. On an entry whose printer is unreachable at the old IP (the common DHCP-move case) it is exactly **one reload**.
- If the printer is **unreachable at the new address**, the entry ends in `SETUP_ERROR` / `SETUP_RETRY` and the service reports failure in its response. **Check the response (or the logs) before assuming success.**

### `start_print` (Centauri Carbon 2 only)
Starts a G-code file that is **already in the printer's local storage** - the "print this again" the Elegoo app offers, which is lost in LAN Only mode. Uploading a file is not part of this service; the slicer does that.

```yaml
action: elegoo_printer.start_print
data:
  entry_id: <config entry UUID>
  filename: "benchy.gcode"   # exact name from the printer's file list
  tray: 2                    # optional, Canvas tray 0-3 (A1-A4) for G-code tool 0
  bed_leveling: true         # optional, default true: auto bed leveling first (~3 min), as the slicer does
```

- The response says whether the printer accepted the job: `error_code` 1009 means it is busy.
- `tray` is validated by Home Assistant, **not by the printer** - an out-of-range tray is acknowledged with `error_code` 0 and silently printed from tray 0. Only G-code tool 0 is mapped; this service does not preserve a complete multi-tool mapping.
- `bed_leveling` maps to the protocol's `printer_check`, which ElegooSlicer sends on every job - so it defaults to on. With `false` the key is left out and the printer levels only when it decides to on its own (observed after a bed-temperature change).
- Not available for the first-generation Centauri Carbon or resin printers, where the equivalent SDCP command crashed the printer (#297).

### `upload_gcode` (Centauri Carbon 2 only)
Uploads a G-code file **from the device you are using Home Assistant on** to the printer's local storage, and optionally starts it. In **Developer Tools → Actions** the `file` field opens a file picker (filtered to `.gcode`); the file goes to Home Assistant first and from there to the printer over the LAN, the way ElegooSlicer sends it (`PUT /upload` in 1 MB chunks). It then appears in the printer's file list and can be started with `start_print` or from the printer's screen.

```yaml
action: elegoo_printer.upload_gcode
data:
  entry_id: <config entry UUID>
  file: <file_id from the file picker>
  start: true               # optional, default false
  tray: 2                   # optional, with start
  bed_leveling: true        # optional, with start, default true
```

- Up to 100 MB (Home Assistant's upload limit). The file keeps its name; an existing file of the same name is replaced.
- The upload is not retried: if the printer answers "busy" (HTTP 429) or rejects a chunk, the service reports it and stops - the printer does not list a failed upload.
- In an automation the `file` field needs a file id from Home Assistant's upload API; the field is meant for the UI.

## 📊 Entities
The integration provides a comprehensive set of entities including **Live Camera**, **Print Thumbnails**, **Control Buttons** (Stop/Pause/Resume), and a full suite of **Sensors** (Progress, Temps, Layers, Z-Height, etc.).

**Filament / Canvas A1–A4 sensors (CC1 and CC2):** Gcode file-detail and optional proxy sensors are created at setup time (proxy extras are only added when a proxy URL is configured). They stay **available** between prints; when there is no current job data they report **unknown** rather than becoming **unavailable**, so automations and history are not disrupted each time a print ends.

**Print file (CC2):** a select listing the G-code files in the printer's local storage, read over MQTT (method 1044) every ten minutes and on the **Refresh File List** button. Choosing a file does not start it: press **Print Selected File**, which prints from the tray chosen in **Print Tray** (Automatic or A1-A4, Canvas printers only) with bed leveling on, as in the slicer - or pass the select's state to `start_print` as `filename` to skip leveling.

## 🤖 Automation Blueprints
Includes a blueprint for mobile notifications. [Import it here.](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https://github.com/danielcherubini/elegoo-homeassistant/blob/main/blueprints/automation/elegoo_printer/elegoo_printer_progress.yaml)

## 🧵 Spoolman Integration
Compatible with
[Spoolman Home Assistant](https://github.com/Disane87/spoolman-homeassistant).
Some approaches are available depending on your printer and
firmware: automated per-slot tracking for CC2 via the gcode capture
proxy, live extrusion tracking for CC1 with OpenCentauri firmware,
or a filename-template workaround for CC1 on stock firmware. See
[SPOOLMAN.md](SPOOLMAN.md) for setup and example automations.
